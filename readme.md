# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.

_Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only._

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning

	- [Term Deposit Prediction Model](https://github.com/kumarmanglam/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Term_Deposit_prediction_model/FD_soln.ipynb): Successfully implemented prediction model using Logistic regression and Decision tree algorithm. Predicted if the client will make a fixed deposit with the bank based on the age of the client, job type, marital status, etc.
	- [Forecast hourly bike rental demand](https://github.com/kumarmanglam/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Forcast_Hourly_bike_rental_demand/Benchmark%20solution.ipynb): Successfully implemented prediction model using Linear regression and Decision tree algorithm. Predicted if a person will rent a bike based on time, season, holiday, working day, weather, temperature, humidity, windspeed, registered.


	_Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pygame_
